Welcome! I am a second-year **Systems and Network Engineering** student at [TED University](https://ted-university.com/),an **InfoSec enthusiast** and developer passionate about building **games** and **security Tools**

I hold the [eJPT certification](https://ine.com/security/certifications/ejpt-certification) and am currently pursuing the [CRTP certification](https://www.alteredsecurity.com/adlab) and the [Zero2Automated course](https://courses.0ffset.net/),I have also completed the Udemy [Agentic AI](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-agentic-ai-engineering-course/?couponCode=MT250923G1) Course

I enjoy working on personal projects such as creating InfoSec tools, automation scripts and small security projects as well as performing reverse engineering on binaries both statically and dynamically. I also explore game development, experimenting with Unity and C# as a hobby.

My strongest programming language is **Python** though I also work with **C** and **C#**.

My long-term goal is to become a skilled penetration tester and to build tools that help security researchers. 

This blog documents my learning journey in **malware research**,**CTF** (writeups),**security concepts** and whatever else catches my interest in **InfoSec**, **Agentic AI**, or **game development**
