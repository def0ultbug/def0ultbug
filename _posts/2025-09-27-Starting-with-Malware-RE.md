As I explore the cybersecurity world, one path keeps drawing me in **malware reverse engineering**(**MRE**). It’s as challenging as it is captivating, requiring a mix of analytical thinking, creativity and patience to uncover what’s hidden.This article explains what **MRE** is, why it matters, the environments and tools I use,and the resources that helped me learn it (free + paid).

For me, the biggest reason was curiosity and problem solving. MRE feels like solving a complex puzzle. Like a detective searching for clues.


### **What Is Malware Reverse Engineering, and Why Do we Need It?**

**Malware Reverse Engineering** is the art of taking apart malicious software (`malware`) to understand what it does , how it works , the techniques it uses to stay hidden and what kind of damage it may be designed to cause and uncover the attacker's full **blueprint**.

**The Two primary approaches**

**1. Static Analysis**:
  > `Static analysis` studies malware without running it, inspects a malware file (**headers**, **hashes**, **strings**) and uses tools like `Ghidra` or `IDA` to translate machine code into readable assembly.

**2. Dynamic Analysis**:
  > `Dynamic analysis` involves running the binary and analyzing it as it executes to observe its behavior,using a debugger like `x64dbg` to step through the code and see how it executes.

**Why it matters ?**

Reversing malware reveals tactics, techniques, and **TTPs**. That enables security teams to create precise detections, write incident response playbooks, and patch vulnerabilities or misconfigurations attackers exploit.

I think before start learning **MRE**, you should have a basic familiarity with the following concepts.

## **Prerequisites (recommended)**
- Basic programming: `Python` and you need to have familiarity with `C/C++` (one of them or both).
- Windows internals: `processes`, `services`, `registry`, `PE format basics`.
- `Assembly` basics (x86/x64): understanding function calls and registers.


## **Environments I use**

I work with with multiple **Windows** VMs and a **Linux toolbox** for analysis:

  - **Windows 7** (64-bit) — separate VMs for **static** and **dynamic** analysis.
  - **Windows 10** (64-bit) — for analyzing modern malware and testing tools.

I Use `Flare VM` which provides with several good reversing engineering
tools

 - **FlareVM:** <https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm>



For Linux tooling and scripting tasks I use `REMnux`

 - **REMnux:** <https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/get-virtual-appliance>



Now let’s move on to the tools.

### Tools

Most of these are available in `Flare VM` & `REMnux`. I’ve grouped them by purpose.

**Static analysis :**
  - `Detect It Easy (DIE)` — file type detection
  - `Ghidra`, `IDA Pro` (disassemblers)
  - `capa` — identification
  - `Oletools` & `Malwoverview`
  - `CyberChef` — quick decoding/transforms
  - `dnSpy` — .NET decompiler
  - `Microsoft, Libre` — for Office/macros
  - `PEStudio` — PE inspection
  - Text editors (Sublime, VS Code), Python 3


**Dynamic analysis :**
  - `x64dbg` — debugger for Windows binaries
  - `ANY.RUN` & `capesandbox` — interactive sandbox
  -  `dnSpy` — .NET debugger
  - `Wireshark` — Packet Analyzer & capture
  - `HxD` — Hex Editor
  - `Process Hacker` — process inspection
  - `Procmon` — filesystem/registry monitoring 
  - `RegShot` — registry snapshot comparison
  - `FakeNet-NG`, `ApateDNS` — network/DNS simulation
  - `YARA`— creating signatures to identify malware



## **Resources I used**
### **💰 Paid**

![Desktop View](assets/img/posts/malwarere/image.png){: width="272" height="389" .w-50 .right}
1. [**Zero2Automated (Advanced Malware Analysis)**](https://courses.0ffset.net/)
- hands-on labs for unpacking, shellcode, debugging, and advanced reverse engineering. I **recommend** it for its practical labs and depth.


2. [**Practical Malware Analysis & Triage**](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-malware-analysis-triage)
- I haven’t personally tried it, but it comes highly recommended by many in the community.

### **🆓 Free**

1. [**Malware Unicorn’s Reverse Engineering 101**](https://malwareunicorn.org/workshops/re101.html) — Beginner-friendly RE Windows malware

2. **YouTube Channels 🎥**  
- [The Cyber Yeti](https://www.youtube.com/@jstrosch) → Great walkthroughs on malware analysis and reverse engineering
- [HuskyHacks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtJgZIyoZ0wIKEzctj_8pZQ) → has a great course highly **recommend**
- [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnHammond010) → has some videos about **MRE**  

3. **[Malware Traffic Analysis](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/) 🌐** — Provides real-world **network captures (PCAPs)** for hands-on practice  
 

And I highly recommend practicing on more real **samples** found on sites like:
- [**theZoo**](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo) — collection of live malware for research. 
- [**MalwareBazaar** (abuse.ch)](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/) — curated malware samples with metadata.
- [**samples**](https://github.com/StrikeReady-Inc/samples/tree/main) — repo has collection of samples
- [**VirusShare**](https://virusshare.com/) — same as MalwareBazaar collection of malware samples

> check this [**malpedia**](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/) it provides technical information about malware.

## **Platforms I use**
- [**Crackmes.one**](https://crackmes.one/) collection of RE challenges
- [**TryHackMe**](https://tryhackme.com/) — beginner-friendly hands-on labs and learning paths, including Windows/RE and malware-analysis rooms.
- [**Hack The Box**](https://www.hackthebox.com/) — more advanced hands-on labs and real-world-like machines; excellent for sharpening practical skills and CTF-style problems.  

## **Final Thoughts**

**Malware reverse engineering** is a field that requires lifelong learning. If you want to work in InfoSec, it’s a skill worth developing. Getting started can feel overwhelming, but by building a solid foundation learning Windows internals, assembly, and programming and **practicing consistently**, you will steadily grow your skills.
